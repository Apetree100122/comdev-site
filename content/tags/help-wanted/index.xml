      <description>Help wanted &amp;para; This page can probably just redirect to the events.apache.org website, would anything be missing if we do that?
Calendar &amp;para; This calendar lists major events relating to The Apache Software Foundation and our many Apache projects. We also have an automated listing of upcoming Apache-related Meetups (smaller events) available.
This Calendar is maintained by Apache Community Development volunteers (ComDev); to have your event listed considered for addition please mail dev@community.</description>
