      <description>The ASF and our many projects welcome all participants. Before you begin, it is important to review and respect our community guidelines. We have a few ASF-specific tips below.
Code of Conduct &amp;para; The ASF has adopted a Code of Conduct which covers interactions in all the online spaces that ASF projects use - email, issue trackers, wikis, websites, IRC, and the like. ASF projects are made up of volunteers, and we work to ensure that all productive contributions are welcomed.</description>

      <description>Read the mailing list Contribute code (and other things) End user support Documentation Review PRs and tickets Be visible Test, and vote on releases (non-binding) Give talks   Disclaimer &amp;para; Nothing in this post should be construed as a guarantee. You can do everything listed here, for years, and still not become a committer. This is because the decision is made by individuals on the project PMC, who do things for their own reasons.</description>
