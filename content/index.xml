      <title>A Maturity Model for Apache Projects</title>
      <link>https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html</link>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html</guid>
      <description>The Apache Project Maturity Model provides a suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), many of these factors apply to any open source project.
Overview &amp;para; The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.</description>

      <description>Apache Committer Newsletter, April 2017 &amp;para; Dear Apache Committer,
In this newsletter: committer resources you might not know about, Foundation news, and upcoming community events.
Thank you for your hard work on our Apache projects. You are the reason the Foundation exists, and your work is the reason we have the reputation we enjoy.
In our recent community survey, we heard from a lot of you that you want more information about what committer resources are available, how to connect with developers from other projects, and more information about whatâ€™s going on in the Foundation at large.</description>

      <description>The ASF and our many projects welcome all participants. Before you begin, it is important to review and respect our community guidelines. We have a few ASF-specific tips below.
Code of Conduct &amp;para; The ASF has adopted a Code of Conduct which covers interactions in all the online spaces that ASF projects use - email, issue trackers, wikis, websites, IRC, and the like. ASF projects are made up of volunteers, and we work to ensure that all productive contributions are welcomed.</description>

      <description>Projects at the ASF offer a way to grow in your responsibilities in the project, from being a user, all the way up to being a maintainer of the project. While the specific details may look different from one project to another, the rungs of the ladder look mostly the same.

You can do everything listed here, for years, and still not become a committer.

      <description>Almost everything and everyone at Apache use email lists to get work done, including this Community Development project right here! When people send email to a list, many other community members get the message, and someone usually provides a useful reply. Every email list at Apache is archived: most lists are archived publicly. That means that newcomers to a community can learn how decisions on a project have been made in the past, because all the email discussions a project has had are archived.</description>

      <description>In some cases there is no obvious path to take, or you might be a new community, or a new member of an existing community. In these cases people often need to build consensus by making proposals and eliciting responses.
Constructive discussion is the lifeblood of a successful project. However, we want to avoid unnecessary discussion and significant amounts of unnecessary mail that everyone in the community needs to read. so many ASF projects adopt a shorthand notation for showing support, or otherwise, for a proposal.</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html</guid>
      <description>The most important thing about engaging with any Apache project is that everyone is equal. All project participants with an opinion can express that opinion and, where appropriate, have the community consider it.
To some, the idea of having to establish consensus in a large and distributed team sounds inefficient and frustrating. Don&amp;rsquo;t despair, though: The Apache Way has a set of simple processes to ensure things proceed at a good pace.</description>

      <description>Some Apache committers have successfully run funding campaigns to support their work on their favorite Apache projects.
This is ok in principle, but you have to make it clear that the campaign is your own thing, and avoid any confusion about the role of the ASF and how its projects work.
This page gives a few examples of how to do that.

Finding the right project &amp;para; The key to working on projects at Apache (and on any open source project, for that matter) is to have a personal reason for being involved. You might be trying to solve a day job issue or learn a new technology, or simply want to do something fun in your free time.</description>

      <description>A comprehensive guide to being a GSoC admin for the ASF
List of duties:
Make sure the ASF has an extensive list of project ideas ready shortly after Google announces the program (around the end of January). Projects must create Jira issues for their ideas and label them with gsoc&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;; and mentor. If a project doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Jira, have them create the ideas in the GSOC Jira project. Create a Jira filter for these ideas to use in the application (see next).</description>

      <description>Submitting ideas to the mentoring programme &amp;para; We invite all ASF projects to submit their ideas for consideration in the ASF mentoring programme. Any Apache member and experienced committers can submit ideas via Jira (if your project does not use Jira you can use the Comdev GSoC Issue Tracker For GSoC Tasks. We are looking for as many interesting projects as we can come up with.
Important Steps &amp;para; Add an issue to Jira (if your project does not use Jira you can use the Comdev GSoC Issue Tracker For GSoC Tasks Add sub-tasks if necessary Label the main issue with &amp;ldquo;mentor&amp;rdquo; (these will show up at the ASF-wide list of issues) Label the main issue with &amp;ldquo;gsoc2023&amp;rdquo; if appropriate (these will show up at GSoC 2023 Ideas) Size of project Starting this year there are 2 types of projects available.</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/mentor-request-mail.html</guid>
      <description>Having identified a Top Level Project (TLP) and an issue you would like to work on, it is a good idea to introduce yourself to the project community and outline your plans for tackling the issue. This lets the community know you are working on the issue and gives the community an early opportunity to help course correct your proposal, if necessary (which can save you lots of time).
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what your first email might look like:</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html</guid>
      <description>The concept of &amp;ldquo;lazy consensus&amp;rdquo; is very important in your project. Lazy consensus means that when you are convinced that you know what the community would like to see happen, you can assume that you have consensus in favor of the proposed work and can get on with it. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to insist people discuss and/or approve your plan, and you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t need to call a vote to get approval.</description>

Inclusion and transparency &amp;para; Mailing lists ensure that all members of the community can participate on a level field, regardless of time zone or availability, whereas synchronous communication platforms (IRC, Slack, Discord, etc.</description>

(So that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put them all in the first edition)
If you blog about anything Apache related, you might want to know about http://planet.apache.org/committers/ - the Apache committer blog aggregator. Itâ€™s valuable in seeing what the rest of the Apache community is working on. To add yourself to the planet, edit the file https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/committers.ini in svn. Itâ€™s preferable if you use an â€˜apacheâ€™ tag to separate out the stuff that is relevant to the community.</description>

      <description>This page describes the ranking process The Apache Software Foundation uses to evaluate mentee proposals.
The ranking process makes sure the most promising applicants get a mentor with an ASF project. The goal is not to identify the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; projects for the ASF, but the best mentees who have applied to the ASF.
Remember, mentoring is all about the mentee and open source as a whole. It is not about the mentors or their projects.</description>

      <description>Mentoring a new PMC member &amp;para; So I&amp;rsquo;m a PMC member now. What does this mean? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What conversations belong on the private list, as opposed to the public list.
These things vary a little from one project to another, so clearly documenting them for your particular project is critical. And specifically assigning a PMC mentor to new PMC members can greatly help that new member get up to speed, and prevent problems in the future.</description>

      <description>Mentoring: First Patch &amp;para; A beginner&amp;rsquo;s first patch on a project can be an intimidating and frustrating experience. Clearly documenting the entire process from checkout to accepted patch greatly lowers the barrier for a new contributor, and makes it more likely that they&amp;rsquo;ll come back for their second patch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on how to do that.
Outline:
Talk to the project first Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s wanted/welcome See if there&amp;rsquo;s already work in progress, or suggestions Find someone to be your advocate Finding the source Writing a good commit message Following up on your pull request Learning from your struggle: Improving the documentation </description>
