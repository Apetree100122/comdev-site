      <title>A Maturity Model for Apache Projects</title>
      <link>https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html</link>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html</guid>
      <description>The Apache Project Maturity Model provides a suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), many of these factors apply to any open source project.
Overview The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.</description>

      <description>Apache Committer Newsletter, April 2017 Dear Apache Committer,
In this newsletter: committer resources you might not know about, Foundation news, and upcoming community events.
Thank you for your hard work on our Apache projects. You are the reason the Foundation exists, and your work is the reason we have the reputation we enjoy.
In our recent community survey, we heard from a lot of you that you want more information about what committer resources are available, how to connect with developers from other projects, and more information about whatâ€™s going on in the Foundation at large.</description>

      <description>Top-level projects report to the board once a quarter, Incubator podlings usually monthly.
The ASF Board currently meets on the third Wednesday of every month, and projects need to report well in advance of that, as reports are reviewed before the meeting.
This page provides a simple template for board reports and should be read in conjunction with https://apache.org/foundation/board/reporting which contains additional information.
Reports need not be exhaustive, unless you are asking for assistance.</description>

      <description>There are a number of useful Apache tools and services available for Apache projects and committers. This is a brief set of pointers or signposts to that information.
Apache Infrastructure Information The primary portals for Apache Infra questions - how Subversion/Git/Websites, etc. work at the ASF - are pages at apache.org/dev and infra.apache.org.

      <description>Almost everything and everyone at Apache use email lists to get work done, including this Community Development project right here! When people send email to a list, many other community members get the message, and someone usually provides a useful reply. Every email list at Apache is archived: most lists are archived publicly. That means that newcomers to a community can learn how decisions on a project have been made in the past, because all the email discussions a project has had are archived.</description>

      <description>In some cases there is no obvious path to take, or you might be a new community, or a new member of an existing community. In these cases people often need to build consensus by making proposals and eliciting responses.
Constructive discussion is the lifeblood of a successful project. However, we want to avoid unnecessary discussion and significant amounts of unnecessary mail that everyone in the community needs to read. so many ASF projects adopt a shorthand notation for showing support, or otherwise, for a proposal.</description>

      <description>This page is for people who are reasonably comfortable with open source development models but need a helping hand finding their way around the Apache Software Foundation and our way of developing software (commonly called &amp;ldquo;The Apache Way&amp;rdquo;). For those wishing to start from the very beginning, we have a newcomers page.
Project Independence And Policies While not all ASF projects practice all aspects of the Apache Way in the same way, there are a number of rules that Apache projects must follow â€“ things like complying with PMC release voting, legal policy, brand policy, using mailing lists, etc.</description>

      <description>The most important thing about engaging with any Apache project is that everyone is equal. All project participants with an opinion can express that opinion and, where appropriate, have the community consider it.
To some, the idea of having to establish consensus in a large and distributed team sounds inefficient and frustrating. Don&amp;rsquo;t despair, though: The Apache Way has a set of simple processes to ensure things proceed at a good pace.</description>

      <description>Some Apache committers have successfully run funding campaigns to support work on their favorite Apache projects.
This is ok in principle, but you have to make clear that the campaign is your own thing, and avoid any confusion about the role of the ASF and how its projects work.
This page gives a few examples of that.

Finding the right project The key to working on projects at Apache (and on any open source project, for that matter) is to have a personal reason for being involved. You might be trying to solve a day job issue, you might be looking to learn a new technology or you might simply want to do something fun in your free time.</description>

List of duties:
 Make sure the ASF has an extensive list of project ideas ready shortly after Google announces the program (around end of January). Projects are required to create JIRA issues for their ideas and label them with &amp;ldquo;gsoc&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mentor&amp;rdquo;. If a project doesn&amp;rsquo;t use JIRA, have them create the ideas in the COMDEV JIRA project. Create a JIRA filter for these ideas to be used in the application (see next).</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/mentor-request-mail.html</guid>
      <description>Having identified a Top Level Project (TLP) and an issue you would like to work on, it is a good idea to introduce yourself to the project community and outline your plans for tackling the issue. This lets the community know you are working on the issue and gives the community an early opportunity to help course correct your proposal, if necessary (which can save you lots of time).
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what your first email might look like:</description>

      <title>Lazy Consensus</title>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html</guid>
      <description>The concept of &amp;ldquo;lazy consensus&amp;rdquo; is very important in your project. Lazy consensus means that when you are convinced that you know what the community would like to see happen, you can assume that you have consensus in favor of the proposed work and can get on with it. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to insist people discuss and/or approve your plan, and you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t need to call a vote to get approval.</description>

Why? When you&amp;rsquo;re getting involved in a new open source project, it can be a little daunting. You engage in the mailing lists with people from all around the world. You solve bugs with people in different time zones.</description>

      <description>Committer Resources
(So that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put them all in the first edition)
If you blog about anything Apache related, you might want to know about http://planet.apache.org/committers/ - the Apache committer blog aggregator. Itâ€™s valuable in seeing what the rest of the Apache community is working on. To add yourself to the planet, edit the file https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/committers.ini in svn. Itâ€™s preferable if you use an â€˜apacheâ€™ tag to separate out the stuff that is relevant to the community.</description>

      <title>Mentee Ranking Process</title>
      <link>https://community.apache.org/mentee-ranking-process.html</link>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/mentee-ranking-process.html</guid>
      <description>This page describes the ranking process The Apache Software Foundation uses to evaluate mentee proposals.
The ranking process makes sure the most promising applicants get a mentor with an ASF project. The goal is not to identify the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; projects for the ASF, but the best mentees who have applied to the ASF.
Remember, mentoring is all about the mentee and open source as a whole. It is not about the mentors or their projects.</description>

Creating a proposal and finding a mentor  Find the project you are interested in (see our FAQ for some guidance on how to do this) Examine the projects issue tracker to find bugs that need fixing or features that need implementing that you feel you can tackle Join the projects mailing list and post an introduction mail (something like this mentor request mail will do nicely).</description>

      <description>Mentoring A major job of Community Development is mentoring. Mentoring is the process of actively bringing someone along in a discipline - investing your time into influencing the future. Time spent mentoring today will pay off for years to come.
Anyone can be a mentor. You just have to take a moment to encourage someone else to participate.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some concrete ways you can provide mentoring to other members of your community.</description>

      <description>Mentoring a new committer So I&amp;rsquo;m a committer now. What&amp;rsquo;s next? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What are the social conventions around making a commit?
These things vary from one project to another, so clearly documenting them for your particular project is critical.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the basics that are true across (almost) all Apache projects.

      <description>Mentoring a new PMC member So I&amp;rsquo;m a PMC member now. What does this mean? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What conversations belong on the private list, as opposed to the public list.
These things vary a little from one project to another, so clearly documenting them for your particular project is critical. And specifically assigning a PMC mentor to new PMC members can greatly help that new member get up to speed, and prevent problems in the future.</description>

      <description>Mentoring: First Patch A beginner&amp;rsquo;s first patch on a project can be an intimidating and frustrating experience. Clearly documenting the entire process from checkout to accepted patch greatly lowers the barrier for a new contributor, and makes it more likely that they&amp;rsquo;ll come back for their second patch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on how to do that.</description>

      <description>Many projects in the ASF are able to provide mentors for newcomers. In fact, most projects are happy to assist newcomers to their projects as part of their normal operations. However, some people are looking for more structure. The Mentor Programme of the The Apache Software Foundation provides additional support and structure for people looking to make an initial contribution to an ASF project.
The mentoring programme is not here to teach you to write documentation or code.</description>

      <description>Mentoring in Formal Education Some mentees will wish to participate in the Mentoring Programme as part of a formal education course. In these cases there will be additional requirements and process steps to ensure that the mentees can be evaluated by their tutor. This section describes these additional requirements and process.

Overview Projects are defined by the students tutor in consultation with the TLP community/mentors and the student. They will need to be isolated enough from other ongoing work to ensure that success/failure to deliver is not dependent on someone else.</description>

      <description>While not all ASF projects practice all aspects of the Apache Way in the same way, there are a number of rules and policies that Apache projects must follow â€“ things like complying with PMC release voting, legal policy, brand policy, using mailing lists, etc., which are documented in various places.
A community is not merely a set of rules; it is also a set of behaviors that the participants express when interacting within that community.</description>

      <description>Occasionally a &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for consensus is not enough. Sometimes we need to have a measurable consensus, for example, when voting to invite new committers or to approve a release.
Preparing for a Vote It is important to ensure that the community has time to discuss the issue before voting. To do this, post an email to the list indicating the intention to call a vote and the options available. By the time a vote takes place there usually is consensus in the community on what path to take.</description>
