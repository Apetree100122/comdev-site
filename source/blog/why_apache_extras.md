All Apache projects use the same pragmatic software license, the Apache License v2. However, we recognise that there are
other FOSS licences out there, some of which are incompatible with the Apache License v2.

Code under these licenses cannot be hosted on Apache servers, but people sometimes choose to, or are required to, use
them.

Until the launch of [apache-extras](http://apache-extras.org/) these projects had no a single home to go to. They were
spread across all of the various hosting platforms. This made it difficult for communities to cluster around related
technologies. For us this was a problem since we believe strong collaborative communities are the key to successful open
source software.

Apache Extras provides these projects with a way to clearly signal their relationship to one or more Apache project
community. This will help them attract developer communities to their own projects.
