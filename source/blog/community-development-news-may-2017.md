Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)! This month we have
lots of news about ApacheCon North America; share some links to some of the conference keynotes; deliver a co-ordinated
Apache Way track alongside our Community one; get some feedback from a first time ApacheCon attendee; encourage you to
listen to ApacheCon via our FeatherCast podcast channel and we run yet another successful BarCampApache.

### ApacheCon NA 2017

After all the preparation ApacheCon North America took place this month in Miami. As well as the standard ApacheCon and
Big Data tracks, several mini conferences were held around the main event. It also featured a new Apache Way track which
is mentioned in separate section below in more detail.

ApacheCon featured some great keynote speakers with some interesting topics from IoT to Digital Pychometrics. If you
haven't had a chance to hear or see them then they are all available on Youtube as follows:

* [Keynote: State of the Feather - Sam Ruby, President, Apache Software Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFUNz6UP-E)
* [Keynote: Apache Projects and Comcastâ€™s Journey to Open Source - Nithya Ruff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwZEPfICuUE)

The [complete Youtube video playlist from ApacheCon NA Miami](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp)
is also available. For those sessions there were not on video, we have recorded the audio and these are available on
FeatherCast.

During ApacheCon Benjamin Young organised a ComDev Tools Hackathon where people interested in improving some of our
tools got together and started working on it. Thanks very much to Benjamin for this initiative and to all the hackathon
participants who came along to help out. 

### BarCampApache

Our BarCampApache was a great success and attracted well over 35 people. It was facilitated by Jean-Frederic Clere and
some of our attendees on the day. It was great to see so much involvement from people from a wide range of Apache
projects.

The following were some of the topics raised by our participants and discussed:

* MQ in Practice
* Community Engagement & How to Atract More Contributors / Committers
* Benchmarking
* Open Source in China
* Orchestraiton
* YARN/MESOS
* Static Analysis and Project Management

At every BarCampApache a key theme is sharing information and advice as well as making contacts, and I'm sure we
succeeded in doing that. How do we know? The discussions kept on well after the time when we were planning to finish!

So thanks again to everyone that attended and we hope that you will pass on your experiences to other colleagues and
encourage them to participate at future events. 

The audio from
the [BarCampApache is available on FeatherCast](https://feathercast.apache.org/2017/05/30/apachecon-miami-2017-barcampapache/)
. (**WARNING**: This current file is over 5 and a half hours long but we will be splitting this up into more topic based
discussions)

### The Apache Way Track and Community Track

As well as our usual community based track, for the first time at ApacheCon a co-ordinated track detailing different
aspects of the Apache Way was organised by Shane Curcuru and Nick Burch. The five presentations and one panel discussion
incorporated common themes and explored some of the challenges encountered.

### FeatherCast Audio from ApacheCon

Our Community Development [podcast channel FeatherCast](https://feathercast.apache.org/) has been extremely busy this
month. Before ApacheCon we were recording interviews with some of the speakers and during the conference itself we
talked to attendees, sponsors and some of our Apache Directors and Officers. We now have a large amount of content for
you to listen to.

Also don't worry if you missed missed ApacheCon or couldn't make to all the sessions because they have all been
recorded. You can find the audio for all the ApacheCon sessions on [FeatherCast](https://feathercast.apache.org/).
Thanks very much to all the people who worked hard to get this audio up so quickly after ApacheCon.

Please follow [FeatherCast on Twitter](https://twitter.com/feathercast?lang=en) to be informed about our latest
interviews. We are always looking for volunteers so if you are interested in helping out with our FeatherCast podcast
channel then please email contact our mailing list feather@apache.org

### First Time ApacheCon Experience - Stephen Downie

If you haven't taken a look at the blog post by Stephen Downie then it is highly recommended. Miami was Stephen's his
first ever ApacheCon and his blog post describes his experiences all the way through from apprehension to realisation.

Stephen's full blog post can be found here. [My First Experience of ApacheCon Blog Post by Stephen Downie](./my-first-experience-of-apachecon.html)

### OpenExpo in Madrid

During May we promoted that we had been invited to have an Apache booth at the Open Expo in Madrid on 1st June. This is
a new event for us and we wanted to find out whether it could be a good place to have an Apache presence at in the
future. We understand that the conference had over 3000 visitors and 300 of them passed by our Apache booth not only to
pick up stickers but to also find out more about the Foundation itself. Please take a look
at [our detailed blog post about the event](https://s.apache.org/9uem).

A big thank you to Ignasi Barrera, Jan Iversen and Sharan Foga who spent the day on booth duty during the event.
