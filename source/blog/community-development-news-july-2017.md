Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)! You may have
noticed that we missed our June issue, this was due to the holiday season so we have a double update for you this month.
This month we have lots of news about upcoming conferences that we are interested in participating at, we share a more
detailed blog post about the OpenExpo in Madrid, we remind everyone to find us on Twitter, and provide a pointer to how
to help fix misuses of Apache project brands.

### Call for Apache Project Presentations for Solutions Hamburg

We have been invited to provide a 3 day track filled with Apache content
for [Solutions Hamburg](https://solutions.hamburg/). The conference runs from 6th-8th September 2017. This is an
established conference that is attended by a wide range of people and businesses so could be a great opportunity to
inform a new audience about Apache and our projects. Our proposed 3 day Apache track will be broken down into the
following areas:

* Dev-Day with Developer-Centric Apache project talks
* Ops-Day with Operations-Centric Apache project talks
* Apache Day with talks on Apache itself

An initial call for participation went out on the ComDev mailing lists in June and so far several people have
volunteered to do presentations but we could always do with more!. So if your project fits into any of these categories
and you would like to participate then please let us know by:

* Responding to the [Solutions Hamburg mailing list thread](https://s.apache.org/JJzL)

**Please note**: that the presentation can be in English or German.

This will be a new event for Apache and once again it is another opportunity to have a presence, spread the Apache
message and grow our communities. A very big thank you to Chris Dutz for initiating this and also Myrle Krantz for
helping summarise and organise the prospective talks.

### Open Source Summit Europe 2017

This month we had some discussions on our mailing list about participating in
the [Open Source Summit Europe 2017](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe) which runs from
23-26 October 2017 in Prague, Czech Republic. This conference is actually a consolidation of several other conferences
including LinuxCon, ContainerCon, the Open Community Conference and
the [Diversity Empowerment Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe/program/diversity-empowerment-summit)
.

Although we could not get scheduling for a specific Apache track, many of the topics covered in the Apache Way
presentations are very relevant to open source communities and several presentations have been submitted via the CFP.
The schedule will be announced 17th August so thanks to everyone who submitted a proposal and we hope that some Apache
related content will be included.

### ASF Booth at MesosCon Europe 2017

We have been offered an Apache booth
at [MesosCon Europe 2017](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe) which is happening from 25-27
October in Prague, Czech Republic. MesosCon is an established conference from
the [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) community that runs globally. This year their European conference is
co-located alongside the Open Source Summit and it is great that Community Development will be having a presence at this
Apache project event.

Thanks very much to Piergiorgio Lucidi and Sharan Foga for volunteering to help out with MesosCon booth duty.

### Introducing FOSS Backstage

Over the last few months there has been some detailed discussions on our mailing list about creating a new conference
event that would be more focussed on open source governance and community related topics. The new event has now been
created and is called [FOSS Backstage](http://foss-backstage.de/).

While the main conference is planned June 2018, a micro FOSS Backstage summit has been organised for 20th November 2017
in Berlin.The [CFP for the FOSS Backstage Micro Summit 2017](https://s.apache.org/YEzo) is now open so please submit
your proposals. The deadline for submissions is **10th September 2017** and you can find out more details from
the [FOSS Backstage website](https://s.apache.org/YEzo).

A very big thanks to Isabel Drost-Fromm for making this initiative happen.

### Blog Post re: OpenExpo in Madrid

In our May blog post we talked about our participation at the OpenExpo conference in Madrid. It was our first time at
this event and have written a short blog post about it

Being at the OpenExpo also opened up a new opportunity to talk to people about Apache. A local Spanish podcast channel
focussed on open source software asked us to record an interview (in Spanish) about Apache. Ignasi Barrera was
interviewed and the podcast can be found at the link below:

Once again, a big thank you to everyone who helped to make this event a success.

### Help Fix Misuses Of Apache Project Brands

Have you ever seen a corporate website or press release that claims they run an Apache project, or seen someone using
Apache project names or logos improperly? We have a guide for fixing that - but it requires **you** to raise the issue
up so the PMC can address it! We hope all committers and expect that PMC members will speak up if someone is misusing
their project's brand.
