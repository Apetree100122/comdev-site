Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)!

This month we have news about the Apache EU Roadshow and FOSS Backstage conferences in Berlin, we talk about our
participation at the OpenExpo Europe, we interview speakers, attendees and Board members for FeatherCast and we prepare
for participation in even more conferences.

### Apache EU Roadshow

This month our [Apache EU Roadshow](https://s.apache.org/rvjm) was held in Berlin. Our Apache Lounge was very popular as
an informal meetup space to sit, relax, hack or generally catch up. As well as stickers our special giveaway item was
ice cream which went down very well with attendees. For those who attended, we hope that you enjoyed the event. A huge
thank you to all the speakers who participated at the EU Roadshow and also all the volunteers who gave up their time to
make it happen.

Photos from the Roadshow and FOSS Backstage can be found at the following links:

Two of the roadshow tracks were recorded (Cloud, Http/Microservices) and are available on the Apache EU Roadshow
Playlist on the [ASF Youtube Channel](https://s.apache.org/AGvP).

You can find all the videos from the Apache EU Roadshow at the link below:

If you have any feedback that you think could help us make our next event even better then please feel free to contact
us.

### FOSS Backstage

We also had a lot of Apache participation at FOSS Backstage. Their focus on governance, community and the legal aspects
of open source is very relevant to the ASF. There were a wide range of interesting talks, discussions and workshops and
you can find the videos at the link below:

* [FOSS Backstage Videos](https://s.apache.org/ag06)

We look forward to future events where we hopefully can continue to participate.

### FeatherCast Interviews

[FeatherCast](https://feathercast.apache.org/) is the ASF podcast channel and we usually try to do interviews with
speakers or attendees at events. The Apache EU Roadshow and FOSS Backstage were great places for finding interviewees.
Instead of an audio recording, this time thanks to Rich Bowen, we also have video interviews. The first two interviews
have already been published and you can find them at the links below:

* [Apache Spamassassin: Kevin McGrail](https://s.apache.org/VVk2)
* [Apache Fineract: Myrle Krantz](https://s.apache.org/IGz8)

These short interviews give a brief overview about the project and its community. So if you want to know a little more
about either of these project then watch the interviews!

As well as interviews with conference attendees and speakers, we have started a short series of interviews called 'Board
Conversations' where members of the Board of Directors for the Apache Software Foundation talk about their role.

* [What does Membership at The Apache Software Foundation mean?](https://s.apache.org/Y6QW)
* [What Does the Apache Board of Directors Do?](https://s.apache.org/VDrA)

We are always looking for new people to talk to and interview so if you are interested in doing a FeatherCast interview
about your project or your involvement with Apache then please contact us.

### OpenExpo Europe Madrid

This year we participated again at the [Open Expo Europe](https://openexpoeurope.com/). It is an event in Spain focused
on open technologies, and we were pleased to see that there were several talks about Apache projects. We had some
members of the community attending the event to staff the Apache booth and present talks about open source, community
development and the Apache way:

* Luciano Resende, Piergiorgio Lucidi and Ignasi Barrera held an open debate about the Challenges projects face when going open source.
* Ismaël Mejía presented a talk (in Spanish) about [_Building software and communities the Apache Way_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fwJzargPNaC937ftGBfndV14Y4cOG11YrGfkbQTD_wU)

You can read more details about the event, venue, and the different talks that took place
in [this great blog post](https://www.open4dev.com/journal/2018/6/7/apache-members-at-openexpo-europe-2018-wrap-up) by
Piergiorgio Lucidi.

Thanks very much to everyone who helped support our participation and involvement in this event!

### Apache Booth at OSCON 2018

We have been given a free booth at [OSCON 2018](https://s.apache.org/3l1g) so we will have volunteers there giving away
stickers, swag and ready to talk to attendees about the ASF. We also have a few presentations being given by Apache
contributors such as the following:

* Jim Jagielski will be participating in a [discussion about Innersource](https://s.apache.org/8yCB)
* Myrle Krantz will be talking about [Financial Inclusion](https://s.apache.org/wdQ1)
* Daniel Ruggeri will be talking about [companies contributing to Open Source](https://s.apache.org/zCJ3) 

If you are attending the please feel free to drop by our to booth to chat with any of our volunteers.

### Codemotion Events - Europe

We have been invited to participate in three [Codemotion events](https://codemotionworld.com/) later this year in
Berlin, Milan and Madrid. We are looking for speakers and volunteers to help out by talking to people about being
involved in Apache. The [Call for Papers (CFP)](https://s.apache.org/Gmkv) for each event closes in July so please don't
delay if you would like to submit a speaking proposal.

If you are interested in helping out at the Apache booth then please respond at the
following [mailing list thread](https://s.apache.org/dkP3).

Thanks very much to Piergiorgio Lucidi for suggesting and helping follow up on Apache participation at Codemotion.
