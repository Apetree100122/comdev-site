Welcome to the first in a series of monthly blog updates about what is happening in Apache Community Development. This
month we have news about our Committer Diversity Survey, FOSDEM 2017, ApacheCon NA 2017 and our PMC grows.

### Apache Committers Diversity Survey

Over the last month we have been discussing diversity within the ASF and this month we sent out our first ever Apache
Software Foundation Committer Diversity Survey. The committer group was selected because they are a large group that are
linked to every Apache project. (**NOTE**: The ASF currently has 5861 committers across 295 projects). To ensure the
confidentiality and privacy of the respondents, the survey is anonymous and completely voluntary. 

Our survey is currently in progress and thank you to all the committers that have already responded. Ideally we would
like to see as many responses as possible so that we can get a clearer picture of how good the ASF is at attracting and
welcoming a diverse range of people into its communities. 

If you would like more information on the survey and why we are capturing this information then please see

[community.apache.org/blog/the_apache_community_development_team.html](./the_apache_community_development_team.html)

**NOTE**: If you are committer and haven't received the survey link then please contact our community development mailing list

The survey closes on 11th December 2016.

### FOSDEM 2017

Once again the ASF will be running a booth at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/). The conference will take place over
the weekend of 4th & 5th February 2017 in Brussels. Entrance is free and it has always attracted thousands of attendees
so is a great place to talk to people about Apache, its projects and also its communities. As well as the usual list of
developer rooms, this year FOSDEM will be featuring a Community DevRoom specifically for community related topics and
presentations.

Volunteers from the Community Development community will be helping manage and run the booth throughout the 2 day
conference but we are always happy to have additional help. If you are planning to attend FOSDEM and would like to spend
some time on the ASF booth promoting your ASF project then we can organise a specific time for you. Please contact
the [community development mailing list](https://s.apache.org/qdrd) for more information.

### New PMC Member - Sharan Foga

The Apache Community Development PMC is pleased to announce that Sharan Foga has been voted in as a new PMC member.
Sharan has been involved in a range of community development activities both on and off the mailing lists. She has
actively supported the ASF at conferences such as Apachecon and FOSDEM, and more recently she has been working on
developing strategies and initiatives for encouraging diversity within the ASF. Please join us in welcoming Sharan to
the team.

### ApacheCon North America 2017

ApacheCon North America will be held at the Miami Intercontinental, May 15-19th, 2017. The call for papers is open for
