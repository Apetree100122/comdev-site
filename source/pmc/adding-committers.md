The addition of new committers is essential to the long-term 
sustainability of an open source project. The PMC is responsible for
determining who will be added as a committer.

* Who should be a committer?
* Vote process
* What to do when a committer is elected

Note: Formal policy/process document is here: https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#committer-management
