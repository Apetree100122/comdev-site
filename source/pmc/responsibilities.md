## Conducting Business

The PMC is expected to conduct all of its business on the public
developers mailing list, in the full view of the community.

The private@ list is for communication about private matters, such as
discussion of proposed committers, proposed new PMC members, and
communication from the Board of Directors. Do not use it for discussion
of features, roadmap, or other technical decisions.

The Board of Directors will occasionally send you comments or queries,
often related to your quarterly board report. Any PMC member can, and
should, respond to these. You should not wait for the Chair to respond
to these queries.

The PMC is tasked with making decisions on the direction of the project,
They can, and should, also incorporate the voice of the larger community
in these decisions. However, if a vote is taken, only the votes of the
PMC are binding on the outcome. Other community members may vote as
well, but those votes are advisory only, and not binding.

A PMC member may veto a technical decision, such as a proposed patch.
However, they must be able to back this veto up with a technical reason,
and be willing to discuss possible resolutions to their objection.
