---

This calendar lists major events relating to The Apache Software Foundation
and our many Apache projects.  We also have an automated
[listing of upcoming Apache-related Meetups][5] (smaller events) available.

This Calendar is maintained by Apache Community Development volunteers (ComDev);
to have your event listed considered for addition please mail [dev@community.apache.org][1].
Note that to be listed in this calendar events must <b>already</b> conform
to the [Third Party Event Branding Policy][2] and have been approved by
either the relevant Apache PMC or the Branding Committee.

## Upcoming Events

<em>Disclaimer: Events called 'ApacheCon' or 'Apache Roadshow' are
official Apache Software Foundation events. Other listed events are put
on by projects, or third-party producers, and are listed here to support
our community, but are not official Foundation events.</em>

## Other Related Events

In addition to major conferences that have applied for approval with us, there are a wide range of other
events which feature Apache projects and technologies. A list of upcoming
[Apache related Meetups is available][5], powered in part by [this script][6]
(patches welcome!). Secondly, a crowd-sourced list of related events is maintained
as a [Lanyrd Guide][4], and we encourage people to help list
Apache project related events there.
