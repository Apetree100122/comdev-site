title: Mailing lists
---

The ASF has a long tradition of using mailing lists as the primary
communication format in projects. This is not merely because we've
always done it that way, but is an intentional decision for the health
and sustainability of our communities.

## Inclusion and transparency

Mailing lists ensure that all members of the community can participate
on a level field, regardless of time zone or availability, whereas
synchronous communication platforms (IRC, Slack, Discord, etc.) benefit
only those who are online, and in the channel, at the time of the 
conversation.

Mailing lists also allow archiving, so that decisions can be understood
by people who were not there at the time - what was decided, why, and by
whom - even years after the fact.

Synchronous communication platforms are great for end-user support,
where an answer is needed quickly, and asking for clarification can be
done real-time. It's also good for social interactions, and for quick
brainstorming.

But decisions, and important technical discussions, should be taken back
to the mailing list so that the whole community can participate.

This is why we say, at the ASF, **If it didn't happen on the mailing
list, it didn't happen.**

## Mailing list etiquette

*To Be Written*

* Meaningful subject lines
* Inline vs top-posting
* HTML and "rich text" messages
* Clear language, use of colloquialisms and metaphor, etc. (writing for a
  diverse audience)

## Mailing list configuration

Modern software development tools, including GitHub, your various ticket
trackers, and CI tools, generate a lot of email. This can make your
development mailing list difficult to approach for new contributors, as
they appear as a wall of identical subject lines. This makes it hard for
beginners to break into your project, and find out what's going on.

Here's some configuration tips for your mailing lists to cut through the
noise and make your project's lists more approachable and welcoming.
