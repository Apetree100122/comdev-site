title: Voting
---

Occasionally a "feel" for consensus is not enough. Sometimes we need to 
have a measurable consensus, for example, when voting to invite new committers or 
to approve a release. 

## Preparing for a Vote

It is important to ensure that the community has time to
discuss the issue before voting. To do this, post an email to the list
indicating the intention to call a vote and the options available. By the time
a vote takes place there usually is [consensus in the community][1] on what path to take. The vote 
itself is, normally, a formality; however, it is important as part of the record of the decisions of the PMC and the development of the project.

## Calling a Vote

Once it is time to call the vote, the proposer or a member of the PMC posts an email with the subject line starting 
with **[VOTE]**. This helps community members not miss
an important vote thread. It also indicates that this is not a consensus-building conversation
but a formal vote.

### Casting Your Vote

The notation used in voting is:

  - +1 Yes, I agree 
  -  0 I have no strong opinion 
  - -1 I object on the following grounds

If you object you **must** support your objection and provide an alternative course 
of action that you are willing and able to implement (where appropriate).
