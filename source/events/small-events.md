# Approval of small Apache-related events

The Community Development PMC is responsible for assisting with the
organisation and promotion of all Apache events. 

Organizers of Apache-related events need approval for using the
Apache trademarks in their event brandings. 

The main steps are:

a) Get approval from the PMCs of the projects that your event is about.

b) Abide by the [Apache branding rules](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html).

c) Once brand use is approved by the respective PMCs, inform the community 
development PMC of your event, including references to PMCs approval. 
Ideally on our public (dev@community.apache.org) mailing list,
but at least in private (private@community.apache.org). 

d) Wait at least 72 hours for comments from the community development PMC
and then send an announcement of your event to
dev@community.apache.org so that it can be included in our 
[events calendar](../calendars/).
