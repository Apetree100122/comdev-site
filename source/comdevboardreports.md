Like every other ASF project, the ComDev PMC sends a [quarterly report to the board](https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting).  These reports are read by the board, and sometimes directors will ask the PMC for clarification or to make suggestions for the project.

You can read the complete list of [Apache Community Development board reports](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Community_Development.html).  A [chronological view of all minutes from ASF Board meetings](https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar.html#board-meeting-minutes) is also public.
